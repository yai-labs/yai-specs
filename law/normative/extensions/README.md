# Extensions

Extensions are lawful, domain-specific additions to the core contracts.
They must not redefine or conflict with base axioms, invariants, or boundaries.

## Structure

- `compliance/` - compliance-law extensions bound to the compliance specs

## Change Procedure

- Add new extension documents with clear IDs.
- Update `SPEC_MAP.md` when new extension folders are added.
- Ensure extensions reference the canonical specs they bind to.
