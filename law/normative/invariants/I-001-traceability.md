# I-001 — Traceability

## Invariant Statement

In YAI, traceability is non-negotiable.

Every action, decision, and state transition that is considered valid must be:

- attributable to an explicit authority source and a declared intent
- reconstructable after execution
- explainable within YAI’s conceptual model (authority → intent → conditions → effects)

Traceability is not a tooling feature. It is a structural property of the system.

A system that cannot preserve traceability cannot preserve authority, governance, or responsibility, and is therefore not a valid instance of YAI.

## What This Invariant Constrains

This invariant constrains any component or layer that can produce, authorize, trigger, or record behavior, including:

- actions (external effects, I/O, writes, emissions)
- decisions (routing, planning, selection, scoring, resolution)
- state transitions (kernel, engine, mind state, session state, memory state)
- authority enforcement (permit/deny, gating outcomes, policy evaluation)

To satisfy traceability, YAI must preserve minimum semantic evidence for every valid action or transition:

### Attribution

- a canonical authority reference (subject/role/policy or equivalent authority source)
- a declared intent or purpose (what was being attempted, not just what happened)

### Authorization Conditions

- the gating conditions that permitted it (rules, constraints, preconditions)
- the relevant context used to authorize (inputs to control, not just inference)

### Causal Evidence

- inputs (what it acted upon)
- outputs (what it produced)
- effects (what changed, including external effects)
- causal linkage (why this occurred rather than an alternative path)

Important: this is not a log format requirement. It is a requirement that evidence remains causally and semantically meaningful in the YAI model.

## Violation Signal

Traceability is violated if any of the following are true:

- an action or state transition exists without a traceable authority reference
- an action or state transition exists without a declared intent
- a transition exists but cannot be causally reconstructed (missing conditions, inputs, or effects)
- the system can produce external effects that are not attributable and explainable
- trace records exist but are semantically meaningless (timestamps without authority, intent, or conditions)
- tracing is partial in a way that allows unaccountable execution

When violated:

- authority cannot be validated
- governance cannot be enforced
- responsibility cannot be assigned
- behavior cannot be reconstructed

Therefore, the system is non-compliant with YAI regardless of correctness, performance, or intelligence.

## Notes on Scope

This document defines what must be true, not how to implement it.

It does not prescribe:

- logging pipelines, formats, or tooling
- observability metrics
- storage, index, or query mechanisms
- instrumentation frameworks

Those belong to downstream layers, but they must not weaken or reinterpret this invariant.
