# L0 — Vault Boundary

## Purpose

Define the physical boundary of the YAI Vault as the single canonical contract for:

- shared memory layout (header + regions + alignment rules)
- field offsets and packing constraints
- command and state ID registries used across system components (Centralized in `yai_protocol_ids.h`)

If this boundary drifts, the system does not share a common execution surface and is no longer a coherent instance of YAI.

---

## Authority

L0 is the single authority for:

- the Vault memory layout and its invariants
- the canonical ID registry for commands and states (Sovereign ID mapping)
- naming rules for Vault channels and regions

No downstream component may redefine offsets, IDs, or header semantics.

---

## Definitions

**Vault**
A bounded, shared-memory execution surface used for inter-component coordination.

**Vault Channel / Region**
A named memory region with fixed layout rules and a stable semantic role.

**ID Registry**
A canonical mapping for command IDs and state IDs used in cross-language interfaces, defined exclusively in `yai_protocol_ids.h`.

---

## In Scope

- Shared memory layout and field offsets
- Header layout, packing/alignment rules, and versioning
- Command and state ID values (registry)
- Naming rules for channels / regions
- Compatibility rules (what counts as breaking vs compatible change)

---

## Out of Scope

- Execution logic, scheduling, planning
- Policy, intent, or governance workflows
- UI, tooling, or build systems
- Higher-level protocol semantics beyond ID + wire/header constants

---

## Canonical Contract

### Vault Header (Minimum Required Fields)

The Vault header MUST include, at minimum:

- magic (constant signature `0x59414956`)
- version_major, version_minor
- layout_id (identifier for layout family)
- total_size
- region_table_offset
- flags (reserved, forward-compatible)
- checksum or integrity field

The header MUST be:

- explicitly packed/aligned (`#pragma pack(1)`)
- stable across languages (C/Rust)
- validated at kernel startup

---

### Layout and Packing Rules

- All offsets are defined in bytes, relative to Vault base.
- All structs shared across languages MUST define explicit alignment rules.
- No implicit padding reliance is allowed across compilers.
- A layout change that modifies any shared offset is a breaking change unless versioned and gated.

---

### Command and State ID Registry

- All command IDs and state IDs MUST be defined in `law/surfaces/protocol/include/yai_protocol_ids.h`.
- IDs MUST be stable, unique, and non-reused.
- ID ranges ARE reserved:
  - `0x01xx`: Control/Kernel
  - `0x02xx`: Storage/L2
  - `0x03xx`: Provider/Inference (Sovereign)
  - `0xFxxx`: Privileged/Armed

---

### Naming Rules for Channels / Regions

- Names MUST be canonical and stable.
- Names MUST be treated as part of the protocol surface.
- Naming convention: `/yai_vault_<workspace_id>_<region_name>`.

---

## Enforcement / Mechanism

L0 must be enforceable via non-negotiable checks:

- Compile-time offset checks in vault headers (static asserts on offsets/sizes)
- Protocol header constants defined in `law/surfaces/protocol/include/yai_protocol_ids.h`
- Kernel startup validation:
  - header signature check
  - version + layout compatibility check
  - region map check (bounds + alignment)

---

## Interfaces

This boundary binds the following files (non-exhaustive):

- `law/surfaces/protocol/README.md`
- `law/surfaces/protocol/include/protocol.h`, `transport.h`, `yai_protocol_ids.h`
- `../kernel/include/yai_vault.h`
- `TODO(link): runtime shared constants header path in yai repo`
- `mind/src/shared/constants.rs`

---

## Compatibility Policy

Changes are classified as:

**Compatible**
- adding new fields in reserved/extended regions gated by version
- adding new IDs in `yai_protocol_ids.h` without reuse
- adding new regions with explicit offsets

**Breaking**
- modifying existing offsets/sizes/packing behavior
- reordering fields in shared structs
- reusing an ID
- changing naming rules or canonical names

---

## Failure Modes

- Offset drift breaks shared memory interpretation
- ID mismatch causes invalid command/state mapping
- Naming drift fragments the system into incompatible “sub-vaults”

---

## Traceability

L0 must remain compliant with:

- `invariants/I-001-traceability.md`
- `invariants/I-002-determinism.md`
- `invariants/I-003-governance.md`

In particular: changes to L0 MUST be attributable, versioned, and reconstructable.
