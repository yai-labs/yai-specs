# A-001 — Execution

This document defines execution as a foundational axiom of YAI.

Execution is the primary condition for the existence of a YAI system.
All other concepts — intelligence, inference, planning, control, governance — derive their meaning from execution and are constrained by it.

A YAI system that does not execute is not a YAI system.

## Definition of Execution

In YAI, execution is defined as:

A committed, observable state transition in the system’s authoritative state.

Execution is a fact.
It produces effects, alters authoritative state, and establishes responsibility.

Execution is not a theoretical construct, a simulation, or a potential action.
It is something that happens and can be audited.

## Execution Requires an Authoritative State

Execution is only defined relative to an authoritative state model.

A transition that exists only in local memory, speculation, or transient computation
is not execution in the YAI sense.

If a transition cannot be observed and attributed through the system’s authoritative substrate
(e.g. vault, state machine, trace), it is not a valid execution event.

## Execution Is Not Computation

Computation refers to transforming inputs into outputs according to formal rules.

Execution, in YAI:

- may involve computation
- but is not reducible to it

A computation that does not produce a committed state transition is not execution.
Execution implies consequence.

## Execution Is Not Inference

Inference produces propositions, predictions, plans, or intent.
It does not produce committed action.

In YAI:

- inference may suggest
- execution commits

Inference does not authorize execution.
Execution constrains inference.

Any system where inference alone can directly cause execution is invalid by definition.

## Execution Precedes Intelligence

Intelligence in YAI is not a prerequisite for execution.

Instead:

- execution defines the space in which intelligence may operate
- intelligence is evaluated by how it behaves under execution constraints

Execution can exist without intelligence.
Intelligence cannot exist meaningfully without execution constraints.

## Execution Must Be Observable and Accountable

Execution in YAI MUST be:

- observable
- inspectable
- attributable

If an effect cannot be traced to an execution context, it is invalid by default.

Execution establishes responsibility.
Without execution, responsibility cannot exist.

## Canonical Status

This document defines a canonical axiom of YAI.

Any conceptual model or system interpretation that contradicts the principles defined here is incompatible with YAI by definition.

## Scope Notes

This document does not define:

- execution mechanisms
- runtime lifecycles
- scheduling models
- orchestration strategies
- enforcement logic

Those are defined downstream and must remain semantically consistent with this axiom.
