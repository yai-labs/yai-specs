# Docs Policy

`docs/` is informative. It explains and indexes contracts, but it does not
replace normative artifacts.

Rules:
- Keep links relative and repository-local when possible.
- Do not duplicate normative contract text here.
- Point to canonical sources in `SPEC_MAP.md` and `REGISTRY.md`.
- If an informative note conflicts with normative artifacts, normative wins.
