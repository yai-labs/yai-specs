# YAI Specs API (Contracts)

These docs are generated from the normative headers in `contracts/protocol/` and `contracts/vault/`.
They describe the public ABI and wire contracts that consumers must obey.

Quick links:
- `contracts/protocol/`
- `contracts/vault/`
- `contracts/control/`

Normative note:
If runtime code disagrees with these specs, the code is wrong.
